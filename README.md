# Augmented-Reality
Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real world environment where digital objects, contents and informations are overlaid onto the real world with the help of computer generated perceptual information.

DAILY LIFE APPLICATIONS:
1. Education Field - Students can visualize the objects, characters, processes in front of them.
2. Industrial Field - Process trainings, fixing malfunctions, etc can be treated through AR.
3. Commercial Field - Customers can spawn the products like specs, watches, dresses, furnitures, etc in front of them to choose from before buying.
4. Gaming Field - For cool gaming experiences AR can be used.


I have worked on Augmented this Domain, learnt about its importance and application in various fields made some AR applications which we can modify a little bit and deploy it in various real life domains such as Education, Entertainment, E-commerce, Healthcare etc.
